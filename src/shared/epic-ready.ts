/**
 * WHAT THE EPIC SHOULD DO NEXT -- a pure fold over the board.
 *
 * This is the one piece deliberately kept away from the model. "Which cards are
 * ready" is a graph question with an exact answer, and an LLM asked to eyeball a
 * dependency list will occasionally dispatch a card whose dependency is still
 * open. The overseer decides the interesting things (is this card still the
 * right card, does the plan still hold, should we stop); it does not get to
 * decide arithmetic.
 *
 * TWO LANES come out of here:
 *   - `dispatch`  not-started cards whose `depends_on` are all done -> implementer
 *   - `verify`    cards sitting in `in-review` -> a Guard leg, which is the half
 *                 of the DONE-gate that was written and never wired (the existing
 *                 `buildGuardPrompt` had zero callers before epic mode).
 *
 * Concurrency is capped at the run's `concurrency` (default 3). That ceiling is
 * a review ceiling, not a machine one -- see werk-andon.
 *
 * TWO SELECTORS, ONE FOLD. `planEpic` picks the cohort by epic membership;
 * `planTagged` picks it by board TAG, which is what the work-order scanner
 * needs -- an authorised card is authorised whether or not it belongs to an
 * epic. Only the SELECTION differs. Everything after it -- deps, the ceiling,
 * questions, unspawnable, the idle table -- is one body, because a second
 * readiness fold answering the same arithmetic slightly differently is the exact
 * drift the scanner fabric exists to end (scanner-work-orders).
